# Constant Over Linear

## Vertical Asymptope

This is determined by any zero that is in the denominator.

## Horizontal Asymptope

Compare the degree of the numerator, *n*, with the degree of the denominator, *m*.

If *n* < *m*, the horizontal asymptote is *y* = 0.

If *n* = *m*, the horizontal asymptote is given by *y* = leading coefficient of the numerator / leading coefficient of the denominator

If *n* > *m*, there is no horizontal asymptote.

## Find x & y intercept

This is done by setting the opposite to zero and solving.

## Finishing touches

Find two points on each side of the vertical asymptope.
